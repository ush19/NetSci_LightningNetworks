# COSC421-networkSci_LightningNetwork
The bitcoin lightning network was proposed in 2015 by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja as a potential solution to the bitcoin scalability problem that arises due to the limited transaction capacity of the bitcoin blockchain1   . It is often argued that the lightning network can be completely distributed; however, the network displays typical tendencies of a decentralized network due to the presence of banking hubs2   . The goal of this project was to analyze the bitcoin lightning network data in order to determine if these banking hubs do in fact exist in the network. To achieve this goal, the data was processed using a range of methods, the most significant being Microsoft Excel, the R programming language, and different R methods available through a variety of packages.
